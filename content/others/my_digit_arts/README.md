# My Digital Arts

This folder contains some of my created SVGs. They are mostly for fun and practice, but I hope you enjoy them!

## MGR

The reason I created this is that I wanted to build a game sharing website. But currently, it is discontinued due to the lack of time and resources.

The 16x16 is actually made pixel by pixel using `rect`. With the help of Gemini, I was able to replace the `rect` elements with `path` elements, which makes the SVGs much smaller.

## DNAs

I created these to build my personal bioinformatics website.

## LICENSE CC BY-NC

You are free to use these SVGs for non-commercial purposes, but please give me credit by linking back to my website or GitHub profile.
