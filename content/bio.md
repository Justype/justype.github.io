# Ziyue Cheng

I am a PhD student at the [faculty of health science](https://healthsci.mcmaster.ca/) of [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/), supervised by [Prof. Hong Han](https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/hanh33). 

Currently, I am working on **single-cell sequencing** and **spatial transcriptomics** to study a malignant brain tumor called **glioblastoma**. 

I am also interested in **developing computational methods** to analyze single-cell sequencing data. But it requires the knowledge of both biology and computer science, which is a tough nut to crack.

I am now learning discrete mathematics, linear algebra, and probability theory to improve my mathematical foundation. I am also learning graph theory to catch up with the latest research in **pangenome** analysis and other topology-based methods.

## My Programming and Bioinformatics Journey

I started learning coding in 2017 when I was a freshman at [HZAU](http://www.hzau.edu.cn/). At that time, I wanted to make games with Unity, so I learned C#. Ironically, I never made a game, but I learned a lot about programming and software development (Xamarin at that time, now it is .NET MAUI).

And in my third year, I finally learned about bioinformatics. I was fascinated by the idea of using programming to solve biological problems. Since then, I tried to learning some Python and R, but I didn't have much time to practice.

In 2022, I started my master's degree in biology at [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/). I officially started my journey as a bioinformatician. I learned Python, R, and some shell scripting. I also learned about data analysis, statistics, and machine learning. I was amazed by the power of programming in biology. During my master's degree, I start to learn about new sequencing technologies, such as single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics. I want to contribute to the state-of-the-art in these fields.

Due to various reasons, I decided to continue my studies at [McMaster](https://www.mcmaster.ca/) in 2025. I am working on single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to study glioblastoma.
