# Ziyue Cheng

I am a PhD student at the [faculty of health science](https://healthsci.mcmaster.ca/) of [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/), supervised by [Prof. Hong Han](https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/hanh33). 

Currently, I am working on **single-cell sequencing** and **spatial transcriptomics** to study a malignant brain tumor called **glioblastoma**. 

I am also interested in **developing computational methods** to analyze single-cell sequencing data. But it requires the knowledge of both biology and computer science, which is a tough nut to crack.

I am now learning discrete mathematics, linear algebra, and probability theory to improve my mathematical foundation. I am also learning graph theory to catch up with the latest research in **pangenome** analysis and other topology-based methods.

## My Programming and Bioinformatics Journey

I started learning to code back in 2017 during my first year at [HZAU](http://www.hzau.edu.cn/). I was really into the idea of making games with Unity, so I picked up C#. Ironically, I never actually made a game—but I did fall in love with programming. I ended up learning a lot about software development, especially with tools like [Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin) (which is now [.NET MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui)). 

In my third year, I came across bioinformatics and was immediately interested. The idea of using code to solve biological problems felt exciting and meaningful. I started learning a bit of Python and R, but I didn’t get much practice at that time.  

Things changed in 2022 when I began my master’s in biology at [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/). That’s when I really got into bioinformatics—learning Python, R, shell scripting, and becoming more comfortable with data analysis, statistics, and even some machine learning. I was amazed by how useful coding could be in biology. I also learned about new sequencing technologies like single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, which deepened my interest in research.  

In 2025, I decided to continue my studies at [McMaster](https://www.mcmaster.ca/), where I now work on single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to study glioblastoma. I’m excited to keep learning and contribute to this fast-moving field.
